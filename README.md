# Route Finder
University assignment demonstrating the implementation of the A* search algorithm on the Auckland road network. 

This program takes into account one-way streets and prohibited turns at intersections. Different modes are available to find the shortest route by distance, or the fastest route by time by using the given speed limit information.

Two data sources are provided in the /data folder, organised from the New Zealand Open GPS Project (http://gwprojects.org/forum/index.php).
